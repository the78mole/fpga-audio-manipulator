Some Modules need still some review.
uc_interface now has the same clock as the FPGA since the clock for the 
UC is derived from FPGA clock and also generated by some clock manager 
on the FPGA. This has also to be done before implementing anything on 
the new hardware plattform (V2.0).

Another thing is, that distortion one the one hand looks really finished 
but is still a proof of concept, doesn't work as expected and is not 
implemented as shown in the documentation.

Finally it's one big task to implement distortion as it is described in 
the diagram with the mentioned bit widths and the given modules.

Another task is to write documentation how every vhdl module is implemented.
