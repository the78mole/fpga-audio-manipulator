# fpga-audio-manipulator

This project contains a full stereo analog-digital-analog audio chain to manipulate audio data within an FPGA

The intention of this project was to emulate an audio ADC containing errors to teach students writing test programs for real silicon test systems like the mixed signal test system from SZ.

In general this project can be used to manipulate audio signals, since it contains a full chain of audio ADC and DAC with high sampling rates and bit rates.
